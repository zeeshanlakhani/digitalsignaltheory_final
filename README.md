# DST - Digital Signal Theory - New York University Fall 2007
A project by Zeeshan Lakhani


# What is this repo?
This repository contains MATLAB code (as well as examples) for my final project in DST. This function/program allows a user to process a signal with two different time-scaling algorithms/approaches, SOLA and phase vocoder. Zolzer's *DAFX: Digital Audio Effects* was the main research tool for this project.
